# vim-config

My Vim configuration and extra stuff. Should run on MacVim, Linux (`vim-nox` on Ubuntu usually), and sometimes Windows.

## Setup

`rake install` will download [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), install the bundled plugins,  and link the configuration to your home directory.

`rake install:extra` will link the files in the extra directory to their dotfile counterparts.
